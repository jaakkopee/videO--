Real time operating neural network with visualisation and sound.
Tested on debian 12 with alsa audio and sfml graphics.

The network has a learning algorithm that uses preset activation patterns
and the amplitudes of the oscillatorbank to adjust the weigths of the network.

You can choose the activation patterns from numeric keys 1 to 6
and nudge network weigths with space bar and enter.
